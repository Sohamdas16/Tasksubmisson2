Python Assignment
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that does the following:
•	Takes an integer number as input from the user.
•	Checks whether the entered number is even or odd using an if–else statement.
•	Displays the result on the screen.

Key Features
User Input
•	The program prompts the user to enter a number.
•	The input is converted into an integer using int() so that mathematical operations can be performed.

Conditional Logic
•	The program uses the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
•	If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
•	Otherwise, the number is odd.

THE OUTPUT:
Enter a number:7
7 is an odd number

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.

Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.

Displays the final sum on the screen.

Key Features
•Loop Usage

The program uses a for loop to repeatedly execute a block of code.

The loop runs from 1 to 50 using the range() function.

•Summation Logic

A variable is used to store the running total.

Each number from the loop is added to this variable until the loop ends.

THE OUTPUT:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
