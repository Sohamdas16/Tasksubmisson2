Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that does the following:

Takes an integer number as input from the user.

Checks whether the entered number is even or odd using an if–else statement.

Displays the result on the screen.

Key Features
User Input

The program prompts the user to enter a number.

The input is converted into an integer using int() so that mathematical operations can be performed.

Conditional Logic

The program uses the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

Otherwise, the number is odd.
